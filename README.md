### Full instructions and whatever coming soon.

### For me:
This project is a create-react-app project, using Electron. I followed the instructions at https://medium.freecodecamp.org/building-an-electron-application-with-create-react-app-97945861647c (well, mostly; instead of using Foreman, I used concurrently, and came up with my own scripts strategy. But overall I mostly followed that blog post).
